# Vue-Monster-Slayer-Game
This is a game created using Vue.js where the player(you) have to defeat the monster by attacking it and reducing its health. The monster will of course attack you back when you
attack the monster and will decreas your health too. If your health becomes zero before monster's health, then, monster wins and if monster's health becomes zero before yours, then,
you win.

You can also heal your health and also you have the feature to see the battle-log and restart the game once its finished.
